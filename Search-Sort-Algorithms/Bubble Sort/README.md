# Bubble Sort

## Time Complexities

> Best Case - O(n) Average Case - O(n^2) Worst Case - O(n^2)

- Adaptive Algorithm

- Stable Algorithm

- In-place Algorithm

- Meaningful intermediate result i.e. k passes give k maximum elements

Best Case occurs when the input array is already sorted and hence the loop will terminate after first pass if no swaps are made.

Worst Case occurs when the list is reverse sorted and hence the no of swaps performed are maximum.
