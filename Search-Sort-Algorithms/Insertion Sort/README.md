# Insertion Sort

## Time Complexities 

> Best Case - O(n) Average Case - O(n^2) Worst Case - O(n^2)

- Adaptive Algorithm

- Stable Algorithm

- In-place Algorithm


Best Case occurs when the input array is already sorted and hence the inner loop never gets executed.


 Worst Case occurs when the list is reverse sorted and hence the no of swaps performed are maximum.
